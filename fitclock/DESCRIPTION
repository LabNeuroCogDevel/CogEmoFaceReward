Description: Object-oriented implementation of the time clock algorithm, a
    multiple regression-style prediction of reaction time on each trial of the
    clock task. Implementation fits the standard model including strategic
    exploration (adapting toward uncertainty) from Frank et al. 2009 Nat Neuro,
    and also allows for parameters to vary by contingency or run condition
    (e.g., emotion). Functions are also provided to convolve trial-wise
    regressors with a hemodynamic response function to generate an fMRI design
    matrix.
